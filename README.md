My Game Portal Final

### REQUIREMENTS OF PROJECT:

I do believe everything should be here - in the case it is not, they all should be present within the app

# Note On Fragments and Persistent Data:
I couldn't find a good way to implement these two into the project, but fragments weren't intially thought of when I proposed this idea. 
I hope that this is okay - I did discuss with you about the persistent data, and shared preferences are present. 

## 4 Screens
MainActivity - Game Board Player Name Inputs
gameselect - Selection of the Game
tictac - The tic tac toe game
helpscreen - The help menu ( very basic instructions )

## Multiple Widgets
Text Boxes - Input Of Player Names
Buttons - Reset Button
Images - Home Logo, X and O's on Board

# Additional Info
Two screens were added that were not initially on the page. The Help and WIP screen. 

The WIP screen is the placeholder screen since we had discussed only programming one of the action games

The Help Screen is just a tidbit to kind of explain a little of the game mechanics ( clicking spaces, etc. )

These are just to help 'fill out' the app
